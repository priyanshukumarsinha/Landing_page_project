## Project 6
In Project 6, I made a Website using HTML, CSS and GSAP JS. While making this I learned a little about GSAP JS and how to animate elements with GSAP JS. I made a beutiful website with some micro animations like the button with the hover effect, and that opacity animation while loading the website for the first time. I also added some hover effects on Images so it will move when hovered. I faced several problems while animating, like the third image isn't moving even when i have already given it animation code in JS file.
